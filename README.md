Halftone Image Generator

Using Python Pillow to collect the pixel data and then converting the image to halftone image using 6-pointed stars and hexagons. The stars and hexagons are placed in the image based on the brightess at respective places.
The image resizing is done to get maximum and minute details of the image. However, the extent upto which it should be resized depends upon the original image size. This could be incorporated in the code itself however the current version would work best on images of approximate size of 800X800 - 1000X1000 pixels. The ratio may vary.
